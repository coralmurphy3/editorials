# The Gender Gap in Puerto Rican Publishing

### I wanted to analyze the publishing houses in Puerto Rico by comparing how many books by women each one has published compared to titles by male authors. 

### I decided to scrape two online bookstores that divide their books by publishing house. The e-shops are [Libros787](https://libros787.com/) and [Librer√≠a Isla](https://www.libreriaisla.com/collections/editoriales). 

### I used BeautifulSoup to retrieve the titles and authors of each product listed under a specific publishing house. The code helped me create a table for each publishing house, and I transferred that data into Google Sheets. 

### I manually assigned the gender to each author. 

### I used Flourish to create a hierarchy bubble chart and only analyzed the five biggest publishing houses, measured by the number of books they've published.
